# Oasis Spring Workshop 3: Introduction to the Web!

Welcome to the third Oasis workshop and congratulations on starting to learn about web development! Learning about the basic technologies used in this field will allow you to build your own personal projects, website, apps, etc. And it's fun!

Creating websites and web apps is an extremely rewarding experience, as the software you make is easily testable and accessible by anyone on the web.

In this workshop, we will start by talking about why you should learn how to develop web applications. 

We will then be introducing the three "Languages of the Web"--HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--at a high level before diving into coding with them.

While this will be an introduction, it will set you up to continue learning and growing in these skills.

## Getting Started

If you're just getting started (**recommended**):
1. Go to the Repl.it link in each folder and click Fork


If you want to use your own IDE (if you know how!)
1. Clone this Github repository into a new folder on your machine (in Terminal or Command Prompt, type `git clone REPO_URL`, where REPO_URL is the clone repository found on the top of this page
2. You're all set! Just have the cloned folder easily accessible and follow along with the workshop to start writing web code


## After the Workshop

Well done finishing the workshop! You now have the necessary skills to create your own website from scratch! Soon, you will be able to create web applications using these skills. Moving forward, we would recommend the follow steps to continue developing and learning:

*   Continue reading/following through the tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the W3Schools website: [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    *   This is probably the most beginner-friendly way to become much more accustomed to all three languages
    *   HTML Tutorial: [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
    *   CSS Tutorial: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    *   JavaScript Tutorial: [https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
*   Continue developing pages; try making basic HTML pages, such as a home page for your site, to become more proficient with the syntax you learn from the aforementioned resource
*   After you've got a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## If you couldn't make the workshop

If you were not able to attend, don't worry! There are still many great ways to learn these languages of the web. We'd recommend checking out the resources listed in the [Ultimate Oasis Starting Guide](https://github.com/northeastern-oasis/Ultimate-Oasis-Starting-Guide/tree/master/intro-to-web). Here we recommend some other great tutorials for growing in your knowledge. You can also still use the workshop files as a starting point for your coding. Good luck!
