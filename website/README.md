# Intro to Web Coding: Your Food Blog!

**To get started, open this in Repl.it and Fork it (remember you may have to sign in to Github)**: [https://repl.it/@chessmyers/Website](https://repl.it/@chessmyers/Website)

You will want three files for this site: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`. Note that while you generally should call the home page of your site `index.html` by convention, you can call your CSS and JavaScript files whatever you want.

This site will have various features:

* A main title, that is your website, and the text is in your favorite color
* Your most flattering picture of you to introduce yourself
* A short description of your blog
* A button that will greet the visitor of your site upon pressing it
* A list of entires
	* Each entry should have a **header** title, a short **paragraph** description, an accompanying **image**, a **link** to a recipe, and (optionally) a **button** that will **alert** a joke about the food when pressed
* Some footer text at the bottom of the page
* Anything else you want!

This may not be the most attractive page on the web. But it will be your own, and that's all that counts. Good luck!

## Tips for Getting Started

1. Start by writing the HTML
2. **Feel free** (in fact, we encourage) you copy over contents from the files you already wrote OR the template.html file in the Github repo
3. Add styling next--again, refer back to your past stylesheets and/or copy from them
4. If you're making it interactive, add JS last. 
5. **Ask questions** if you have any
6. Refer to documentation and guides, especially those on [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
